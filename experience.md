    <h2>Research Experience</h2>	
		<div class="experience">
			<h3>Graduate Research Assistant</h3>
			<h4>The University of Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX</h4>
			<p><em>August 2024 - Present</em></p>
			<p>
				Engaged in advanced research in AI and machine learning, focusing on large language models (LLMs) and multimodal data integration across diverse domains including economics, healthcare, and neurodegenerative disease detection.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Exploratory Research on OR & LLMs for Economics:</strong> Investigating the integration of operational research methods (e.g., linear programming, game theory) with LLMs to enhance economic forecasting and policy analysis by reviewing SOTA research and prototyping hybrid models.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Fine-Tuning LLMs for Healthcare Devices:</strong> Implementing advanced fine-tuning strategies (e.g., LoRA, adapter tuning) on LLMs for multimodal wearable sensor data (ECG, accelerometers), and developing robust preprocessing pipelines using Python, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Acoustic Analysis for Alzheimer’s Detection:</strong> Analyzing acoustic features (pitch, rhythm, speech patterns) from voice samples using signal processing (Librosa, SciPy) and deep learning (CNN-LSTM, ensemble methods) to identify early markers of Alzheimer’s.
				</li>
			</ul>

	<h2>Professional Experience</h2>
		<div class="experience">
			<h3>Data Science Specialist</h3>
			<h4>Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Hyderabad, India</h4>
			<p><em>February 2022 - Present</em></p>
			<p>Led data science projects for the quality team, collaborating with stakeholders to identify use cases, design solutions, and deploy models that enhanced manufacturing processes and regulatory compliance.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Designed and implemented a <strong>Root Cause Recommendation system</strong> using NLP techniques to analyze historical quality deviation data, leading to a <strong>23% reduction in the time spent on quality investigations</strong> by suggesting possible root causes and corrective actions (CAPA).</li>
				<li>Developed a <strong>deficiency analytics tool</strong> using NLP techniques for regulatory document analysis. The system provided a <strong>chat-like interface</strong> for users to interact with past deficiencies, flagging potential gaps in content and automatically analyzing large volumes of regulatory documents, improving analysis efficiency by <strong>30%</strong> and ensuring compliance.</li>
				<li>Collaborated across teams to understand process parameters, designing a <strong>forecasting model</strong> to predict equipment failures, reducing unplanned downtime by <strong>20%</strong> and improving maintenance scheduling accuracy.</li>
				<li>Applied optimization algorithms to improve manufacturing and quality processes. Developed scheduling assistant solutions to optimize make span and resource utilization, which had the potential to reduce penalties of ₹10+ Crores.</li>
			</ul>
